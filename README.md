Node bootstrap. Server + Client rendering. Mustache and Backbone. Svalbard because it's cool.

Wat
---

Svalbard is a bootstraping framework including all the things I like and think
are useful for building a modern web application:

* Express for quick serving of things
* Mincer for Sprockets-like compilation of assets, including:
  * LESS for CSS preprocessing
  * Coffeescript and Javascript
* Backbone for elegant client-side scripting
* Mustache for server and client rendering, so you don't have to deal with
SEO or accessbility problems, and so you can support any browser with or
without proper Javascript support
* Organization of configuration in one place

There's a lot left to do, and this will forever be a work in progress.

How
---

Install node.

`npm install`

`npm start`
